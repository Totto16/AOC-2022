# AoC 2016

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2016 repository! The solutions are written in Typescript using Node.js. The solutions aren't optimized for speed, more for readability.

## Running the solutions
For running the code you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
To run it run you first have to install all the needed packages:

 ```
 npm install
 ```

You first have to build the Typescript files
 ```
npm run compile
 ```


You can run it then with

 ```
 npm run all

 or

 npm run start
 ```

For help run
 ```
npm run help
 ```

For more options run it with: 
``` 
node . [options]
```

To see them all you can run the help command.
